## 📌 Introduction
**MyNestEgg** is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help users understand the magic of compound interest and take the first step in planning their financial future.

### What is "NestEgg"?

A **nest egg** is a sum of money that has been saved or invested for the future. The term is commonly used when referring to retirement savings or long-term investments. The idea is to build and grow your financial "egg" over time — safely and steadily — until it’s ready to be used when you need it most.

The name reflects the goal of this app: to help users **grow** their **nest egg** through smart, consistent investments and the power of compound interest.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built with the goal of combining my skills in web development with a meaningful real-world problem: **financial literacy and planning**.

**MyNestEgg** starts simple, with a focus on a core feature — a **Compound Interest Calculator** that:

- Calculates the future value of your money over time.
- Accepts:
  - Initial amount
  - Monthly contributions
  - Interest rate (monthly or annual)
  - Duration (in months or years)
  - Annual contribution growth (e.g. inflation or salary increase)
- Returns:
  - Total accumulated amount
  - Total interest earned
  - Total contribution made

- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Savings goals and projections

- Historical interest rates simulation
- Authentication and personal dashboards
